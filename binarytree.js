//can have a max of 2 children(pointers) && every node can have 0,1,or 2 children
// these can be .left or .right pointers (2 dimensions)
// left or right! 
// binaryTreeNodes
// root of tree is at top! 
// node with no children === leaf! 
// all nodes from root to left is called a branch! 
// branching recursion! we can have more than 1
// recursive call for our stack frame 
// BinarySearchTree!!! ---if balanced give us a O(logn)operation
// BInarySearchTree! 
// 1.every node val must be more than .left value 
// 2. less than .right childs value 
// validating tree- checking if children is balances BST

// BREAD First SEARCH!!!
// BFS!
// queue - an array we add and remote items in in a specific
// order. First in and first out!
